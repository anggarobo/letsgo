  var city = "Jakarta"

  lastName string = "Prabowo"
  Age = 17
  var isMerried bool = true
```

### Multi Variable

```
  var job, hobby, interest string = "Software Engineer", "Pingpong", "Reading"
  date, month, year := 29, "February", 1998
```

### Underscore `_`

```
	_ = "underscore allow a variable is not used"
  greeting, _ := "good morning!", "underscore var is predefined but not for this"
```
